# Changelog

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- Added event when application services are built

## [2.0.2] - 2025-05-03

### Changed
- Changed way servies are created in editor, so now they are always created before default Awake order the same as builds.

## [2.0.1] - 2025-05-03

### Added
- Added Nullable service injection support, so if a service doesnt exist it doesnt throw an exception when using nullables.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-04-30

### Added
- Added `InjectService` Attribute.
  - This attribute cna be applied to properties on services. When a service is started, it will be injected with its requested services.
  - SceneServices can also have ApplicationServices injected, if the scene doesnt contain a service of the requested type
- Added service locator extension methods for scene type
### Changed
- Added null check to GameObject when calling GameObject.TryGetService, so it doesnt attempt to use GameObject when destroyed (e.g. within scene unload)
### Remove
  - Removed MonoBehaviour extension methods for getting services. 
    - This is to discourage from using GetService and TryGetService within a scene services and instead to use InjectService. 
      - This is so services can be put into Application or SceneServices, or from monobehaviour to pure csharp services, with minimal changes.
  - 

## [1.0.7] - 2025-04-29

### Changed
- Scene Services are now unloaded by a GameObject added to each scene, rather than Unload callback from scene manager.
  - This is to fix an issue where the service that are gameobjects were already destroyed before the Unload callback.

### Changed
- Ensure services are not initialized again if loading back into the first scene.

## [1.0.3] - 2025-04-19

### Added
- **GameObject** and **MonoBehaviour** extension methods `this.GetService<T>` and `this.TryGetService<T>`
  - These functions will first try to get the scene service for a type, and then fall back to the application service if the scene doesnt have that type.
- `RegisterAsService` attribute to automatically register MonoBehaviours as services.
  - SceneServices: The attribute must be on a MonoBehaviour on a root GameObject in the Scene.
  - ApplicationServices: The attribute must be on a MonoBehaviour on the root GameObject of the prefab.
